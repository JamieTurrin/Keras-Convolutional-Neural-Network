# Keras-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Program to identify images of happy people using a convolutional neural network

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented using keras package.
See https://keras.io/models/model  for documentation on keras.

Keras is a high-level framework for building deep neural networks quickly
and can run on top of TensorFlow if desired

Identify images in which people are 'happy'
Dataset is 750 RGB photos of faces, 600 for training, 150 for test set

Achieves ~98% train accuracy and ~95% test accuracy
